### 🧭 Overview

**RetailMart** is a hands-on SQL Server project designed to showcase SQL skills from **beginner to advanced**.  
It simulates a small retail business and demonstrates practical data-engineering and analytics concepts such as:

- Database design & normalization  
- Data population with realistic retail data  
- Analytical queries (joins, aggregations, CTEs, window functions)  
- Business insights & KPI reporting  
- Query optimization and indexing  

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **learning and portfolio project** for mastering SQL step-by-step — without using any other programming language.
